## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r history}
library(historydata)
summary(us_national_population)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r uspop, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = us_national_population)+
  aes(x = year, y = population) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
